# What Blog Articles Psychologists MUST Write to Be Found on Google and AI

> **In brief:** Your website presents your practice, but your blog articles are what make you visible, credible, and chosen by people who do not know you yet. Focus on 5 types of articles: FAQs, your approach, fears, common issues, and personal stories. These articles help you appear on Google and in AI recommendations.

## 1. Why Your Articles Trigger Decisions

You are a psychologist. Your profession is built on listening, trust, and human connection.

But before someone meets you, they "read" you:

- They read Google
- They read your profile
- They read your website
- They read your articles

> It is often your articles that trigger the decision to book an appointment.

## 2. Why a Blog Is Much More Powerful Than You Think

When someone types on Google:

- "how to know if I should see a psychologist"
- "managing anxiety alone"
- "sleep disorders stress"
- "fear of seeing a therapist"
- "first therapy session"

It is not presentation pages that appear. It is articles.

And these articles are read by:

| Reader | What They Do |
|--------|--------------|
| Google | Indexes and ranks your content |
| Visitors | Seek answers and reassurance |
| AI systems | ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, Google Gemini recommend professionals |

> The more you answer these questions, the more you become the obvious answer.

## 3. The 5 Types of Articles That Actually Bring You Patients

### Type 1 — Questions Everyone Asks

These are the most powerful articles.

| Question | SEO Impact |
|----------|-----------|
| How do I know if I should see a psychologist? | Very strong |
| How many sessions should I expect? | Strong |
| Is it normal to hesitate about therapy? | Strong |
| Psychologist vs psychiatrist: what's the difference? | Very strong |
| Is therapy covered by insurance? | Strong |

- My approach to anxiety disorders
- My vision of psychological support
- My approach for children / adults / couples

> These articles create a connection before the first appointment.

### Type 3 — Articles That Address Fears

- Do I have to talk about my past?
- Can I see a therapist even if "things aren't that bad"?
- Common misconceptions about psychologists

> These articles often trigger the decision to act.

### Type 4 — Articles About Common Issues

This is where SEO really takes off:

- Managing daily stress
- Recognizing signs of an anxiety disorder
- Understanding mental load
- Sleep difficulties and anxiety
- Emotional exhaustion

These topics are heavily searched on Google. And these are exactly the questions AI uses to recommend professionals.

### Type 5 — Articles That Talk About You

- My training and specializations
- My background

> They humanize your practice.

## 4. Why These Articles Are Strategic Today

It is no longer just about SEO.

Artificial intelligences analyze your website content to answer user questions.

If someone asks an AI:

> "A psychologist for managing anxiety near me"

The AI will look for websites that clearly discuss these topics.

Your articles become entry points.

## 5. How to Find Ideas Without Overthinking

Very simple. Write down the questions people ask you:

| Source | Example Questions |
|--------|-------------------|
| On the phone | "How long does therapy take?" |
| In consultations | "Is what I'm feeling normal?" |
| By email | "Do you work with couples?" |

These are exactly the topics to turn into articles.

## 6. How to Write Simply (and Effectively)

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Clear title that looks like a real question | "How many therapy sessions do I need?" |
| Simple sentences | Avoid jargon |
| Concrete explanations | Give examples |
| Human, reassuring tone | Speak as you would to a patient |
| Link to your contact page | Always |

> You do not need to write perfectly. A useful article is worth infinitely more than a perfect article that is never published.
