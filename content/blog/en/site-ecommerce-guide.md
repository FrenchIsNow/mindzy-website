## 1. Understanding E-commerce

If your business involves selling products, understanding how an e-commerce website works is essential.

It is a structure designed to:

|----------|---------|
| Showcase | Display products attractively |
| Convince | Provide information and proof |
| Reassure | Build trust and credibility |
| Process payments | Handle transactions securely |
| Deliver | Manage fulfillment and shipping |

All automatically.

2. Understand them
3. Add them to cart
4. Pay online
5. Receive their order

> Unlike a brochure website, here the sole objective is: to sell.
