# Google Business Profile for Therapists: The #1 Lever to Be Found and Chosen

> **In brief:** When someone searches for a therapist, they start with Google Maps, not your website. Your Google Business profile is your first point of contact and determines whether they click or move on. Combined with a reassuring website, it forms a powerful visibility system that also helps AI recommend you.

When someone searches for a therapist, they do not start with your website. They start with Google Maps.

Your Google Business profile is therefore your first point of contact. It is what determines whether someone clicks on your profile or moves on to the next one.

## 1. The Winning Duo: Google Profile + Website

There is a crucial point that many overlook:

> The profile attracts, the website reassures and validates the choice.

| Situation | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Profile poorly done | You are invisible |
| Profile well done | You receive calls without advertising |
| No reassuring website behind it | You lose patients |

Both are complementary and essential.

## 2. First Impressions Happen Online

Your profession is built on trust, listening, and human connection.

Yet, the first impression does not happen in your office. It happens online, in just a few seconds.

When someone searches for:

- "therapist near me"
- "wellness support"
- "stress management"
- "sleep specialist"

Google first displays profiles. Not websites. Not social media.

> In less than 10 seconds, the person decides: "I'll contact this person" or "I'll move on to the next."

Your profile acts as a filter.

## 3. What Google Values (and Few Therapists Do)

Google promotes profiles that are:

| Criteria | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| Complete | All fields filled in |
| Consistent | Same info everywhere |
| Active | Regular posts |
| Rich in photos | Real images of your office |
| Rich in reviews | Social proof |
| Well-written | Clear description |

> An empty profile equals invisible. A structured profile equals automatically promoted.

---

## 4. The Elements That Make an Immediate Difference

### 4.1 A Clear and Reassuring Description

Explain:

- Who you work with
- What issues you address
- How a session works
- What the person can expect

> Google reads this description. AI does too.

### 4.2 Real Photos of Your Office

Potential patients want to know where they are going:

- Waiting room
- Office
- Atmosphere
- Lighting

This is incredibly reassuring.

### 4.3 Reviews and Your Responses

Reviews create social proof. Your responses show your professional demeanor.

> Respond to every review, positive or negative, with professionalism.

### 4.4 A Direct Appointment Link

The fewer steps there are, the more inquiries you receive.

Add a direct link to:
- Your booking system
- Or your contact page

---

## 5. Why Your Website Is Essential

After seeing your profile, people very often click through to your website.

And that is where the second level of trust is established.

**Your website allows you to:**

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Detail your approach | Show expertise |
| Explain your methods | Build understanding |
| Answer patient questions | Reduce anxiety |
| Demonstrate professionalism | Confirm credibility |

> A profile creates interest. A website validates the choice.

Without a website, you lose credibility.

---

## 6. What Very Few Therapists Know

Artificial intelligences like ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, or Google Gemini also use information from your Google profile.

When someone asks an AI:

> "Which therapist can help me nearby?"

The AI analyzes:

- Google profiles
- Reviews
- Descriptions
- Information consistency

Your profile therefore also helps you be recommended by AI. And your website reinforces this understanding.

## 7. The Most Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Description too short or missing | Google does not promote you |
| Few photos | Less trust signals |
| Imprecise hours | Confusion and frustration |
| No posts published | Appears inactive |
| No responses to reviews | Seems unprofessional |
| No linked website | Loses credibility |

---

## 8. How to Effectively Optimize Your Profile

### Optimization Checklist:

1. Fill in all fields
2. Add photos regularly
3. Publish small informative posts
4. Encourage reviews
5. Respond to every review
6. Link your website and appointment booking

These details make all the difference.

## 9. The Reality

Many therapists think their problem is their website.

In reality, their problem is often their Google profile.

But the opposite is also true:

> A perfect profile without a reassuring website behind it loses patients.

Both are complementary and essential.
