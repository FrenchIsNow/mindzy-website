# How to Genuinely Improve Your Visibility Through Blog Articles

> **In brief:** Your website presents your business. Your blog makes it findable. Blog articles are now read by Google, visitors, and AI systems. One article per month creates 12 entry points to your website per year. Consistency matters more than perfection.

Your website presents your business. Your blog makes your business findable.

Without a blog, you are only visible to people who already know your name. With a blog, you become visible to everyone searching for a solution without knowing you exist.

## 1. Why Blogging Has Become Essential

When someone types a question related to your field on Google, it is not "Services" pages that appear. It is articles.

And today, these articles are read by:

| Reader | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Google | The search engine indexes and ranks |
| Your visitors | Looking for answers |
| Artificial intelligence | ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, Google Gemini |

> If you do not write, you do not appear.

## 2. The Concrete Benefits of Running a Blog

A well-used blog allows you to:

2. Answer the real questions your clients are asking
3. Demonstrate your expertise without selling
4. Build trust before the first contact
5. Get recommended by Google and AI systems
6. Multiply the "entry points" to your website

Each article becomes a new opportunity to be found.

| Everyday problems | Difficulties they encounter |

## 6. Optimizing Your SEO Through Articles

A well-written article for your readers is also an article that pleases Google.

### Simple rules to follow:

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Clear title | Resembles a real search query |
| Length | At least 600 words |
| Structure | Well-organized subheadings |
| Internal links | To other pages on your website |
| URL | Simple, with the article's topic |
| CTA | Link to your contact page |

> It is not technical. It is logical.

## 7. Why This Works Even Better Today

The AI will look for websites that specifically discuss this problem.

Your articles become entry points to you.

## 8. Consistency Matters More Than Perfection

One article per month is enough.

After one year:
- 12 articles
- 12 entry points
- 12 topics you can be found for

> An imperfect article that is published is infinitely more useful than a perfect article never written.
